# 'Choose Anything'

It would not be hard to enable this tool to optimize for everything. For example:

- Need to optimize your social network feed for messags of your interest? each message is an asset, so, can be optimized.

- Need optimize for food price / quality, and you have a link to a supermarket website with products? Each food item is an asset.

- Need to find friends of common interests? Each contact in your social networks is a potential friend. Each can be treated as an asset.

- Need to find an interesting job? Each job offer in freelancing platforms is a potential asset.

Things of higher hierarchical complexity should also be possible. For example,

- What events to attend, based on topic, location, schedule.

And so on, including, of course, what securities to buy (portfolio optimization).

- Choose Any Action.
